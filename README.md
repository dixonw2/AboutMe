# About Me

This is a project for me to practice full stack development while building an application that is, effectively, a compilation of mini projects I've wanted to build for a while now!

## Favorite Songs

One of my best friends has been keeping track of his top 13 songs of every year, so in 2017 I decided to do the same. Unlike him, however, I added the rule that the songs must be released in the current year.  If it was released as a single the previous year and included on an album releasing during the current year, and I hadn't heard it before the current year, then it may be included.  After 2017, I decided to add another rule where I cannot add more than one song by a band or artist per year. A band releasing an album that I really like may dominate that year, for example, so this rule forces me to still listen to other new music in order to complete the list.

It's something I look forward to finishing throughout the entire year, and I've discovered some new all-time favorites simply because I had to branch out of what I normally listen to! 

## Events

I've been keeping track of every concert and band I've seen since my very first concert in January 2011, so it's nice to finally get it into a proper database.

## Triple Triad

Triple Triad is a minigame in the video game Final Fantasy VIII.  I find it incredibly fun, so I wanted to make it myself.  Eventually I'd like to add the ability to have a sort of Arena mode to it where the player starts with low level cards and eventually works their way up to the best cards.
